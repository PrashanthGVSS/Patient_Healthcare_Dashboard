1.Admission & Discharge:
Average Length of Stay (ALOS) helps identify hospital efficiency. Reducing ALOS can improve bed turnover and treat more patients.
Frequent diagnoses can help allocate resources effectively.
Bed Occupancy & Utilization:

2.High bed occupancy suggests the need for better capacity management, while low occupancy points to underutilized resources.
Turnover Rate indicates how efficiently beds are being vacated and reoccupied.
Financial Health:

3.Net Billing (Billing Amount - Health Insurance) reveals patient burden. A large gap between total billing and insurance coverage indicates heavy reliance on out-of-pocket payments.
Improving insurance coverage can alleviate financial strain on patients.
Follow-Up Compliance:

4.Tracking compliance with follow-ups ensures better post-discharge care and reduces readmission rates.
Doctor Efficiency:

5.Balancing doctor workload optimizes patient care and reduces wait times.
Patient Feedback:

6.Analyzing feedback can highlight areas of patient satisfaction or dissatisfaction, helping to improve overall care.
